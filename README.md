## Getting Started

### Docker

You can launch the development environment with one command!

```bash
docker-compose up
```

After successful launch, go to the following URL in your browser!
- Backend: http://localhost:3300/graphql
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

:warning: Containers have dependencies, but the next container may start to be started before the preparation is complete.
If it fails for that reason, please specify the start-up separately as follows.

```bash
docker-compose up mysql
```

See `docker-compose.yaml` if you want to know more.

### Local

Then create file `packages/backend/.env` and fill in the environment variables.

```.env.example
DB_HOST="localhost"
DB_PORT="3306"

DB_PASSWORD=""
DB_NAME="nest_next_sample"
```


2. Do a database migration.

```bash
cd packages/backend
yarn install
yarn migrate:run
```

3. Run the startup command for backend.

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

After successful launch, go to http://localhost:3300/graphql in your browser!
